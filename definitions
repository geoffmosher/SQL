Database
  - A collection of data organized in tables
Row
  - A single piece of data, a.k.a., a record
Column / Field 
  - A specific data attribute (e.g., a name)
Statement / Command
  - An instruction translated into machine code by a compiler / interpreter (a.k.a. a query)
  - Directs a SQL server/engine to perform an action against a SQL server object 
    E.g., "SELECT 1" specifies desired table columns/fields to retrieve 
RDBMS = Relational Database Management System 
  - Software used to compose SQL statements 
    E.g., MySQL, PostgresSQL, Oracle DB, SQLite, Microsoft SQL Server 
  - Provide areas in which to compose statements containing clauses: SELECT, FROM, WHERE, ORDER BY
  - Note: SQL statement syntax can vary from one RDBMS to another
Clause
  - Modifiers to statements that specify one or more DB fields (e.g., invoice data, total) from one or more DB tables (invoices) 
    E.g., "ORDER BY" structures results by one or more fields (e.g., total)
Intergier
  - Numeric data
NVARCHAR 
  - Denotes that data is in the form of a character
Schema
  - collection of rules a database will enforce (i.e., its logic)
PEMDAS / BEMDAS - paranthese/brackets, exponents, multiplication, division, addition and subtraction  
  - Parentheses around clause items (...) specifies that they take precdence / should be executed first
  - Useful for statements employing AND clauses to capture two or more required items 
Key icon (in a table)
  - Symbol for a primary key, a unique identifying field for a given table 
  - â€˜Foreign keyâ€™ ðŸ”‘ = {add definition}
Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) 
  - Graphical representation of table relationships 
Sideways figure 8 symbol signifies one-to-many relationships 
  - 
Normalization - process of distributing fields across related tables 
  - Keeps the size of a database small, since it reduces need to duplicate data
