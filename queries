Query writing basics

 - SQL query best practices 
 - Using an alias
 - Sorting and limiting query results 

CONSIDERATIONS
A SQL script can have one ore many queries. Before composing your statements, consider these questions...
- What does your query do?
- What table within the database are you requesting data from? 
- What fields within that table are you interested in? 
- Do you want to exclude any data or filter or omit any range or time period?

CREATING COMMENTS
Best practice: put a comment before any SQL statement you compose
Use plain or natural language to describe each written query 
2 ways to write them…
- Start with two dashes followed by a comment: — THIS IS A COMMENT 
- Create a comment block — /*, return 2 lines down, then */ — whatever goes between there is a comment 
- Format a comment by denoting who created it — 
   CREATED BY: Your-First-Name Your-Last-Name
   CREATE DATE: MM/DD/YYYY
