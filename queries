Query writing basics

 - SQL query best practices 
 - Using an alias
 - Sorting and limiting query results 


CONSIDERATIONS

A SQL script can have one ore many queries. Before composing your statements, consider these questions...
- What does your query do?
- What table within the database are you requesting data from? 
- What fields within that table are you interested in? 
- Do you want to exclude any data or filter or omit any range or time period?


CREATING COMMENTS

Best practice: put a comment before any SQL statement you compose
Use plain or natural language to describe each written query 
2 ways to write them…
- Start with two dashes followed by a comment: — THIS IS A COMMENT 
- Create a comment block — /*, return 2 lines down, then */ — whatever goes between there is a comment 
- Format a comment by denoting who created it — 
   CREATED BY: Your-First-Name Your-Last-Name
   CREATE DATE: MM/DD/YYYY 
   DESCRIPTION: This Is the Structure of a Basic Query 


COMMAND WRITING

Separate commands with commas and a return — e.g.,

“
SELECT
  FirstName,
  LastName,
  Email

FROM 
  Customer
“


CLAUSES

FROM clause points in the direction of the data (i.e., which table)

SELECT clause specifies the columns from the table

ALIAS (“AS” keyword) enables columns to be renamed as desired — e.g., 
  “
  SELECT
    FirstName AS [Customer First Name]
   “
( Open and Closed quotation marks can be used as well — e.g., AS “X Y Z” 
   If the alias word is one word, no brackets or quotes are needed )

Descending order (A-Z) is the default SORT BY order
  - ASC can be added to the right of a column item to sort in ascending order 
  - DESC reverses this to descending order (Z-A)

LIMIT clause restricts the # of rows to the number provided (e.g., LIMIT 10)
